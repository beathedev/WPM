<h1>WPM</h1>
This is a simple Python code that allows you to test your typing speed in the terminal using the curses library. The program loads a random text from a file, displays it on the screen and starts counting your typing speed (in words per minute) as soon as you start typing. It also provides real-time feedback by highlighting incorrect characters in red and correct characters in green. Once you complete the text, the program displays your WPM score and prompts you to start a new test. The code is well-commented and easy to modify, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build a typing speed testing tool.

<p>Here's a simple demonstration of what it looks like:</p>
